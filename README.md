# 🏗️ The Java Blueprint: Bridgelabz Build  
**ID:** 2415500338  

> This repository serves as the official **blueprint and construction log** for my Java development journey, developed during the **Bridgelabz Training Program**.  

This isn’t just a folder of `.java` files — it’s a **structural record** of my growth, from pouring the *“Hello, World!”* foundation to constructing complex, functional Java applications.  
Each commit is a new beam, each class a new room in this evolving Java structure.

## 📐 Project Schematic: Repository Modules  

Each branch represents a dedicated *“wing”* of the Java architectural plan, focusing on specific technical components.

| **Branch Name** | **Module Blueprint (Description)** |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| `java-core` | **Phase 1: The Foundation** — Core syntax, data types, logic, loops, and arrays. |
| `java-oops` | **Phase 2: The Framework** — Object-Oriented *blueprints*: Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation. |
| `packages-in-java` | **Phase 3: Site Organization** — Structuring the project using packages and imports. |
| `wrapper-class` | **Phase 4: Utility & Conversion** — Wrapper Classes, Autoboxing, and Unboxing. |
| `functional-interface` | **Phase 5: Modern Additions** — Functional Interfaces, Default/Static methods, and Lambda preparation. |
| `error-and-exception` | **Phase 6: Safety & Resilience** — Exception Handling “safety protocols” (custom and built-in). |
| `lambda-expression` | **Phase 7: High-Efficiency Systems** — Lambda Expressions for cleaner, high-performance code. |

## 💻 Java Practice Problems — The Construction Blocks  

To reinforce each phase of learning, this repository also includes **hands-on practice problems** — practical “mini-projects” that strengthen understanding and coding accuracy.  
They’re divided into two sections: **Assisted Problems** (guided examples) and **Self Problems** (independent builds).
